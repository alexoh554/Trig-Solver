Flask application that outputs unknown values of a given triangle

## Description
The user will be prompted to input a minimum of three values consisting of sides and/or angles of a triangle that are known. If possible, the program will decide between and use the Sine Law or the Cosine Law (depending on the input) to calculate the values that are unknown to two decimal points.

This program also calculates the ambiguous case if applicable.
